# 🩺 Medical Cost Predictor (Machine Learning Project)

This project predicts medical insurance charges based on personal attributes such as age, gender, BMI, children, smoking status, and region. It was developed using Python as part of my academic final-year project.

## 📌 Overview

The Medical Cost Predictor uses a Linear Regression model to estimate insurance costs based on a dataset of medical and demographic data. The project includes user input functionality and generates a **PDF receipt** showing the predicted amount.
